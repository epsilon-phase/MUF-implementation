# Purpose

This is the start of a project to create a JIT compiler for MUF.

This will use libgccjit.

With any luck, it will end up producing code suitable for inclusion in ProtoMUCK or a derivative thereof, or a proof of concept which will prove its viability.

(C) 2018 Hexaferrum

At the moment, I am implementing the language itself so that I have something 
to test the JIT implementation against. Even if I don't end up implementing it,
what this might end up turning into is a general purpose concatinative(not quite forth)
scripting language.

It's more fun than it looks.
